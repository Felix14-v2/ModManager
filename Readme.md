# ModManager

This is ground up rewrite of the old ModManager which used an index on GitHub and a local sql database. The new version
+uses only the Modrinth API.

### TODO

For a better overview of the current status, take a look at
the [project board](https://github.com/DeathsGun/ModManager/projects/1)

### Credits

- [Prospector](https://github.com/Prospector) for creating ModMenu
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) for creating a public and easy to use API for searching mods
